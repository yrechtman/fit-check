# Fit Check Status

## Current State
- Working: auth, scraper, library, profile, reference items
- Hosted on Vercel with ScraperBee backend

## Issues
- confirmation email flow

## Roadmap
- After I add an item to my wardrobe, the page is static. It doesn't give an indication that you've successfully added the item. Instead it should react and let you add a new item rather than needing to reload the page. Right now it's very easy to add the same item twice by accident by pressing "Save" again because you didn't realize anything actually happened.
- I need to be able to copy and paste an image in right now. It only works via download and upload
- Should add a fit rating for instance "good," "fair," "poor" in red, yellow, green that then displays when you view your whole watch list/library
