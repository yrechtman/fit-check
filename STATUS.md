# Fit Check 
A personal shopping assistant for vintage clothing that helps users evaluate whether items will fit based on their body measurements and existing wardrobe.

## Current State
- Working: auth, scraper, library, profile, reference items
- Hosted on Vercel with ScraperBee backend

## Issues
- confirmation email flow [Need more info from users before we think about this]
- Need to deal with the API key that creates a clunky onboarding experience for users but we can think about it later 

## Roadmap
- real real support
- more robust item names beyond brand. the original prompt should just stay as a field so that we can maintain more context
